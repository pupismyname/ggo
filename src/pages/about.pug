                  |  The Georgia Golden Olympics is a statewide event, held this year in the City of Warner Robins, Georgia, for adults 50 years of age or older. The event provides an opportunity to participate in amateur sports competition, to learn new leisure skills, to discover that physical activity is for all ages, to meet new friends and to share good times. More specifically it is an opportunity to have fun!
                p A variety of activities are held to make it possible for participation regardless of an individual's age or physical ability. Different age divisions and several levels of ability spread the competition out so there is truly something for everyone.
