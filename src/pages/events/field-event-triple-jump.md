### Rules

1. Each competitor will have three (3) jumps. FORMAT: One (1) jump per round for three (3) rounds.
2. The competitor shall first land upon the same foot as that from which he/she has taken off. The other foot shall be used for the second landing, and either or both feet shall be used for the third landing. It shall not be considered a failure or a foul if the competitor, while jumping, touches the ground with the "sleeping" leg.
3. The measurement of each legal jump shall be made at right angles from the take-off line, or the take off line extended, to the nearest break in the landing area made by any part of the body of the competitor (including shoes or uniform).
Note: In order to ensure correct measurement of any jump, it is essential that the surface of the sand in the landing area should be accurately controlled to be level with the take-off board.
4. The placement of the take-off board for men should be at least 13m from the landing area and 10m for women.
5. The distance between the take-off board and the landing area should be at least 21m.

### Scoring

1. The distance resulting from the best performance of the three (3) official jumps will be recorded.
2. Second best jumps are tiebreakers. In the event that there is still a tie, the third best jumps break ties. (No additional jumps.)
