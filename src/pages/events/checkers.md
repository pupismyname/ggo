CHECKERS
NUMBER OF COMPETITORS: OPEN
(See Page 6: Age/Category)
RULES:
1. Single elimination tournament.
2. Play will consist of best 2 out of 3 games with same partner.
3. THE GAME: Checkers is a game played on a checkerboard by two persons. The board has 64 alternating red and
black squares. Each player has 12 round flat pieces called checkers. One set is black, the other red. The players sit
opposite each other and each arranges his checkers on the first three rows of black squares. Two rows in the center
remain open.
The player with the black checkers starts by moving one of his/her checkers one space diagonally forward toward
the red checkers. Then the other player moves a red checker toward the black. The checkers can only move forward
on the black squares. The object of the game is to capture all of the checkers of the opponent, or to black their
progress. If a red checker moves next to a black checker, the black checker can jump over the red checker if a space is
behind the red. The red is removed from the board as the black goes deeper into enemy territory. More than one
checker may be captured at a time. If a checker reaches the back line on the enemy’s side, it is crowned and becomes
king. A second checker is placed on top of the king to distinguish it from the other checkers on the board. A king can
move backward and forward one square at a time, except when it jumps over one or more checkers.
4. EACH PLAYER MUST TAKE HIS/HER JUMPS.
5. PLAYERS MUST MOVE WITHIN 30 SECONDS. If a player does not move within 30 seconds, his/her turn is
forfeited.
6. The game is won when the opponent is unable to make a move. This can happen one of two ways: the entirety of a
player’s pieces was captured by the opponent, or a player’s pieces are all blocked from moving.
7. Time will be called at the end of three games or thirty minutes whichever comes first. The player having captured the
most checkers is named the winner. In a case where both players have captured the same number of checkers at the
end of the time limit, play will continue for an additional 3 minutes.
