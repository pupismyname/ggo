1. Race walking is a progression of steps so taken that unbroken contact with the ground is maintained.
2. These steps must adhere to the rules of race walking, which are:
    1. During the period of each step, the advancing foot of the walker must make contact with the ground before the rear foot leaves the ground.
    2. The supporting leg must be straightened (i.e., not bent at the knee) momentarily when in the vertical upright position.
    3. Failure to adhere to the above definition of race walking will result in disqualification.
3. Competitors may be warned by any judge when, by the mode of their progression, they are in danger of ceasing to comply with the definition of race walking. This warning is given by a judge who displays a white paddle to the competitor inscribed with the symbol of the potential violation (> for "bent knee" and ^^ for "loss of contact").
4. When, in the opinion of three judges, a competitor fails to comply with the definition of race walking, the competitor shall be disqualified and so informed by the Chief Judge.
5. Knees must be visible at all times. \
