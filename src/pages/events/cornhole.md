Scoring
Cancellation Scoring: The approved method of scoring for the sport of cornhole is cancellation scoring. In
cancellation scoring, the points of one player cancel out the points of their opponent. Using this method, only
one player can score in each frame.
Woody: Each woody is worth one (1) point
Cornhole: Each cornhole is worth three (3) points
NOTE: Director reserves the right to change tournament format depending on entry numbers, space restrictions
or other circumstances.
Recording the Score
No cornhole bags shall be moved before the scoring is determined. If the decision is in doubt, the Director/Manager shall
be called to determine the scoring for the frame in question.
Pitching
1. Players alternate pitching bags (one player at a time) until each player has pitched all (four) of his/her bags
2. A player must pitch all (4) cornhole bags from their designated cornhole pitcher’s box.
3. Players must deliver the bag with an under-hand release.
4. One foot or appendage must be completely within the pitcher’s box at the time of releasing the bag.
5. When pitching a bag, players must release the bag before any part of the player’s body touches the ground on or
beyond the foul line.
6. The player who scored starts the next frame. If no score, the player that started the previous frames starts the
next one.
7. Any cornhole bag that leaves a player’s hand once the final step (if taken) and final forward swing of
the delivery process has started, shall count as a pitched bag.
8. A cornhole bag that is accidentally dropped by a player before the final step (if taken) and final

Pitching Out of Turn
If a player pitches out of turn at any time during a frame, their pitch will be considered a Foul Bag and swept from the
playing surface.
If the out-of-turn bag affects any bags in play, their opponent has the option of returning all cornhole bags to their original
position on the playing surface or leaving all bags as they are.
If the error is not discovered until after two (2) cornhole bags have been pitched, the frame shall continue and be scored
accordingly.
If no agreement can be reached the Director/Manager shall be called. The official shall either determine the scoring or
void the inning and order to be re-pitched.
Touching Bags Before Frame is Complete
If any bags in scoring positions are touched by a player, whether intentionally or unintentionally, before all bags during
the frame are pitched, the frame over. The offending player (player that touches the bags) forfeits all remaining bags and
tallies the score for the bags they have already thrown during the frame. The non-offending player tallies 12 points as if
they had thrown (4) cornholes during the frame.
Time Limits – Pitching and Scoring
Pitching – A player must pitch each cornhole bag with (15) seconds of their opponent’s bag coming to rest. In singles
play, once the final bag comes to a rest, each player has 30 seconds to walk to the other end pick up their bags, and ready
themselves to pitch.
Scoring – The frame will be scored 5 seconds after the last bag is pitched, comes to rest, and all bags on the playing
surface have stopped moving. Any bag that moves in position after 5 seconds be scored based on its previous position. If
timing cannot be agreed on, the Director/Manager will score or negate the frame.

3. To Sweep bags (that are considered foul bags) from the playing surface
19
Raking Cornhole Bags
If bags become piled inside the hole and may interfere or obstruct with the next pitch or if there is question as
to whether a cornhole bag would have naturally fallen through the hole, a player may request to rake
the cornhole bags that have fallen inside the hole. To request a rake, the player must audibly ask.
• One or both players may walk to the other board and rake the bags from under the board. One player rakes
and the other player watches.
• A spectator may be called to rake the bags if both players agree.
• A certified official may be called to rake the bags if there is a discrepancy.
• Anytime 4 cornhole bags have entered the hole, or a pile of bags is visible in the hole, a player may request a
rake and will not be charged a timeout.
Important note: During raking, all efforts should be made to leave bags on the playing surface undisrupted, in
their natural state, and to leave bags that may hang on the rim of the hole from falling inside the hole
unnaturally. If a bag is resting on a piled bag, and unavoidably falls into the hole because of raking, then it
shall be counted as a cornhole.
Sweeping Cornhole Bags
If a foul bag lands on the playing surface or comes to rest touching the ground and the board, it must be
removed immediately.
If a player pitches a foul bag which affects any bags in play, their opponent has the option of returning all
cornhole bags to their original position on the playing surface or leaving all bags as they are.

2. A player may only call a time out when it is his/her turn to pitch

4. Players may not touch the cornhole bags or boards during a timeout.
5. Official time outs may be granted in the case of a busted cornhole bag, equipment malfunctions, or other
circumstances at the discretion of the Certified Official. A player will not be charged for time out.
