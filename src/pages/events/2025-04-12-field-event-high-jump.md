(See Page 6: Age/Category)

### Rules

1.  The order of trials shall be determined by lot by the Games Committee.
    
2.  The initial height of the crossbar and the subsequent heights to which the crossbar shall be raised shall be determined by the games committee, and shall be announced to the competitors before the commencement of the competition.
    
3.  Each competitor shall have one attempt in the order drawn, and then those who have failed, if any, shall have a second trial in their regular order, and those who have failed a second time, if any, shall have a third trial in their regular order.
    
4.  Unless there is only one competitor remaining, who has won the competition the bar should never be raised by less than 2cm.
    
5.  The uprights or posts shall not be moved during the competition unless the Referee considers that the take-off or landing pit has become unsuitable. In such a case the change shall be made only after a round has been completed.
    
6.  The competitor must take off from one foot.
    
7.  A competitor fails if:
    
    1.  after the jump, the bar does not remain on the supports because of the action of the competitor while jumping, or
        
    2.  the competitor touches the ground, including the landing area beyond the vertical plane through the edge of the crossbar nearest to the take-off area, either between or outside the uprights, with any part of the body, without first clearing the bar. If the jumperâ€™s foot touches beyond the plane of the uprights while completing a jump, the jump should not be ruled a failure for this reason if no advantage was thereby gained (e.g., the jumper did not use the landing area as a spring device).
        
    3.  during or after the jump, the competitor deliberately steadies or replaces the bar.
        
8.  The apron is a 15m semicircle surrounding the standards.
    
9.  The minimum length suggested for runways is 20m.
    
10.  Markers may be placed in the runway apron.
    
11.  When it is clear that the bar has been displaced by a force not associated with the competitor (e.g., a gust of wind)
    
    1.  if such displacement occurs after the competitor has cleared the bar without touching it, the attempt shall be considered successful, and
        
    2.  if such displacement occurs under any other circumstances, a new attempt will be awarded.
        

### Equipment

1.  If footwear is going to be used by the competitor it must comply with USA Track and Field regulations.
    
2.  Competitors may compete in bare feet.
    

### Scoring

1.  The height resulting from the best performance of the final high jump trials shall be recorded.
    
2.  Tie breaker: a) the competitor with the lowest number of jumps at the height at which the tie occurs shall be awarded the higher place; b) if the tie still remains, the competitor with the lowest total of failures throughout the competition up to and including the height last cleared shall be awarded the higher place; c) if the tie still remains: if it concerns first place, the competitors tying shall have one more jump at the next height, after the height last cleared by the competitors, and if no decision is reached, the bar shall be lowered (if all have failed) or raised by 2cm (if two or more have cleared). The tying competitors shall then attempt one jump at each height until the tie is decided. The tying competitors must jump on each occasion when deciding the tie.
